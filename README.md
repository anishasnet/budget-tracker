# Budget Tracker

## Description
This application allows the user to track their budget by entering their transactions and seeing a visual representation of it. There is offline functionality so that users can track their transactions without internet connection. However, the total will only be updated when the user is connected to the internet again. This application was built using Express, MongoDB, NoSQL, Mongoose, and IndexedDB.
